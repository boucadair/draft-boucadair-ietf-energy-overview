3.  NMRG

   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-green-ps]:  Reducing humankind's environmental
      footprint and making technology more sustainable are among the
      biggest challenges of our age.  Networks play an important part in
      this challenge.  On one hand, they enable applications that help
      to reduce this footprint.  On the other hand, they contribute to
      this footprint themselves in no insignificant way.  Methods to
      make networking technology itself "greener" and to manage and
      operate networks in ways that reduces their environmental
      footprint without impacting their utility therefore need to be
      explored.  This document outlines a corresponding set of
      opportunities, along with associated research challenges, for
      networking technology in general and management technology in
      particular to become "greener", i.e., more sustainable, with
      reduced greenhouse gas emissions and less negative impact on the
      environment.

4.  OPSAWG

   [I-D.opsawg-poweff]:  The Power and Energy Efficiency Telemetry
      Specification seeks to address this inconsistency by providing a
      single reference for these important activities, aiming to create
      value through insights.

5.  MISC

   [RFC8352]:  This document describes the challenges for energy-
      efficient protocol operation on constrained devices and the
      current practices used to overcome those challenges.  It
      summarizes the main link-layer techniques used for energy-
      efficient networking, and it highlights the impact of such
      techniques on the upper-layer protocols so that they can together
      achieve an energy-efficient behavior.  The document also provides
      an overview of energy-efficient mechanisms available at each layer
      of the IETF protocol suite specified for constrained-node
      networks.

   [I-D.cx-green-metrics]:  This document explains the need for network
      instrumentation that allows to assess the power consumption,
      energy efficiency, and carbon footprint associated with a network,
      its equipment, and the services that are provided over it.  It
      also suggests a set of related metrics that, when provided
      visibility into, can help to optimize a network's energy
      efficiency and "greenness".

   [I-D.li-ivy-power]:  Network sustainability is a key issue facing the
      industry.  Networks consume significant amounts of power at a time
      when the cost of power is rising and sensitivity about
      sustainability is very high.  As an industry, we need to find ways
      to optimize the power efficiency of our networks both at a micro
      and macro level.  We have observed that traffic levels fluctuate
      and when traffic ebbs there is much more capacity than is needed.
      Powering off portions of network elements could save a significant
      amount of power, but to scale and be practical, this must be
      automated.  This document proposes a YANG model.

   [I-D.pignataro-eimpact-icmp]:  This document defines a data structure
      that can be appended to selected ICMP messages.  The ICMP
      extension defined herein can be used to gain visibility on
      environmental impact information on the Internet by providing per-
      hop (i.e., per topological network node) power metrics and other
      current or future sustainability metrics.  This will contribute to
      achieving an objective mentioned in the IAB E-Impact workshop.

      The techniques presented are useful not only in a transactional
      setting (e.g., a user-issued traceroute or a ping request), but
      also in a scheduled automated setting where they may be run
      periodically in a mesh across an administrative domain to map out
      environmental- impact metrics.

   [I-D.gudumasu-avtcore-decoder-energy-reduction]:  This document
      describes an RTCP feedback message format for the second type of
      green metadata defined by the ISO/IEC International Standard
      23001-11, known as Energy Efficient Media Consumption (Green
      metadata), developed by the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 3 MPEG System.
      The RTCP feedback messages specified in this specification is
      compatible and complimentary with the other draft on green
      metadata and enables receivers to provide feedback to the senders
      for decoder power reduction and thus allows feedback-based energy
      efficient mechanisms to be implemented.  The feedback message has
      broad applicability in real-time video communication services.

   [I-D.ramos-schc-zero-energy-devices]:  This document describes the
      use of SCHC for very constraint devices.  The use of SCHC will
      bring connectivity to devices with restrained use of battery and
      long delays.

   [I-D.petra-path-energy-api]:  This document describes an API to query
      a network regarding its Energy Traffic Ratio for a given path.

   [I-D.cprjgf-bmwg-powerbench]:  This document defines a mechanism to
      measure, report, and compare power usage of different networking
      devices and under different network configurations and conditions.

   [I-D.cparsk-eimpact-sustainability-considerations]:  This document
      defines a set of sustainability-related terms to be used while
      describing and evaluating environmental impacts of Internet
      technologies.  It also describes several of the design tradeoffs
      for trying to optimize for sustainability along with the other
      common networking metrics such as performance and availability.
